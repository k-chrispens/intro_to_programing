What is Wynton?
</summary>
A Wynton is a **High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster** system made up of many interconnected computers (called nodes) that work together to allow many users execute programs and process data. It's commonly used in research to run simulations, analyze big datasets, or perform tasks that would take too long on a regular computer. Instead of relying on a single machine, you can tap into the combined power of the entire cluster, making it possible to handle more intensive computational tasks.

What is the terminal?
</summary>
The **terminal** is a text-based interface that allows you to interact directly with your computer typing commands, rather than using a graphical interface (like clicking on icons, etc). It might seem intimidating at first, but it's a powerful tool that gives you a lot of control over your computational environment.
